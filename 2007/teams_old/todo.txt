	- heal more liberaly
	- transfer energy from scouts to tanks when tanks need it (and when archons need it, for that matter)
	- make sure we always have tanks
	- be more liberal about healing fighters (they will also be healing tanks)
	- flee EMPs!
	- randonly turn better
	
	
	- better air-force
		- when to make EMPs
	
	












	- roaming EMP strategy, how to stop?
		
	
	- camping EMP strategy, how to stop?
		- camp out ourselves, but build more people...
			maybe get some upgrades as well
			
	- Battletoad strategy, how to stop?





	- re-examine whether EMPs and Scouts (especially) should make us go into attack mode

	- flee when we see an EMP!
		- ours or theirs
		
		
    - make the scout cloud adaptive
        - if it encounters no defense, should make EMP
    	: each scout will be looking out for a set of criterion to be met, including:
    		- I see an archon
    		- I'm on the front lines (no friendlies between me and the archon)
    		- the ratio of goods to bads to high (including SAMs as bads)
    		- then
    			- designate an EMP (well, this should be part of the criterion too)
    		- write EMP code to get closer to archon
    		- write scout healing code to heal EMP
    		
	- perhaps we should have soldiers until we go offensive? (since soldiers may be good defense... not sure)

	- we should refine the building strategy
	    - we should be growing our army when we have more upgrades
	    - don't build tanks early enough: see game 653.rms
    
    - archons tend to get spread out into a line as they walk
    
    
    - if have most of the upgrades, we should wait it out
		- go to a corner
		- build a crap load of tanks
		- have a good emp defense


============================ DONE:
	- eliminate bug where scouts appear stuck on the edge (has to do with waiting for energy to go below 0.5 of max)
    - make scouts focus-fire
	- birds should be covering the leader
	- tanks need to heal better
	- refine building an maintanance of tanks
		- when they are building, everyone needs to wait
			- or maybe have the leader build them?
		- they need to heal each other better
	- criterion for avoidTarget should include the existance of lots of tanks (even if there are not lots of archons,
		the archons might be behind)
	- make the scout cloud do scouting (in particular, it we need to see more upgrades)
	- make the scout cloud tell us whether we would approach or avoid an enemy
		- if it is a single guy (or 2), we should aggresively eliminate it
		- if it is a crap load of tanks, we should stay away
	- refine criterion for entering attack mode
		- right now it's 1 archon, or 1 tank, or 3 soldiers, or 1 EMP, or 1 Scout,
			- there is problem with the 1 scout, we can sortof get pestered with scouts, and not advance
	- fix bug in: 536.rms
		- we can't go toward the enemy archon because we try to go to a space 10 squares away,
			which is behind a wall that we try to go around, until we see him...
		- this might (should) be fixed by better scout cloud direction (i.e. direction from the scout cloud about where to attack)
	- need to code a method of "approaching" the enemy (not to be used in all cases)
	- need to code a method of "avoiding" the enemy
    - any archon needs to be able to call for attack mode..
        - need to make sure there aren't lots of leader exchanges when all archons
            are trying to call for attack mode
    - we should not hit ourselves with tanks when we don't need to
    - refine attacking with tanks,
    	- they should hit better...
    	- they should use weights to decide where to go
    		- what are the weights?
    			- how close are we to the leader?
    			- how much damage will we take?
    			- how much damage can we deliver?
    			- can we kill a certain unit?
    - better inter-tank healing (maybe have them call for help)
    	- problem is that they can't see very well
	- send messages about enemy location more often (or just better, like whenever they change)
    - don't try so hard to find a way around stuff (it'll move soon...)
    	- in particular, don't go in a random direction


















- emp defense with roaming archons
    vs
        emp offense camping

    
- see how well a "sideways" EMP attack works against the huns


- areas for improvement to our strategy:
    - make the scout cloud adaptive
        - if it encounters no defense, should make EMP
        - if it encounters a large ground defense, should not approach
    - if a realScout can't move forward, then go back (bug: they keep trying to move off map)
    - make scouts focus-fire
    - don't go after camping armies
        - this should really be adaptive (scouts saying whether it's ok to attack)
    - archons tend to get spread out into a line as they walk
    - use adaptive EMP defense/offense
        - defense at first,
            but if it sees that they have no defense,
            it becomes an offense
    - better inter-tank healing (maybe have them call for help)
    - we should be growing our army when we have more upgrades
    - when tanks are in attack mode.. they should move around differently,
        don't get so hung up trying to get to leader, perhaps
    - if have most of the upgrades, we should wait it out (ambush of tanks, and EMP defense)
    
    - don't build tanks early enough: see game 653.rms
    - any archon needs to be able to call for attack mode..
        - need to make sure there aren't lots of leader exchanges when all archons
            are trying to call for attack mode

- STRATEGIES to CONSIDER
    - free roaming archons that launch EMPs
        - they could get some successful EMPs from behind,
            even if the opponent managed to kill one (which would try to run away)
    - tank rush on a small map
    - mobile EMP rush (all archons together)



==========================================================
- figure out what's going on with energon transfer
    - it seems like the archons should have a lot more energon sitting on their person





==========================================================

- areas for improvement to our strategy:
    - make EMP defense *good*
    - make better decision about when to attack
        - sometimes we walk past the enemy, sustaining damage,
            because their Archons never get close enough to us for us to enter attack mode
    - lower thresholds for building when we are in no immediate danger
    - better inter-tank healing (maybe have them call for help)
    
    - we should be growing our army when we have more upgrades
    - make good decision about when to attack nearby soldiers, versus their archon
    - tanks should always be oportunistic in attacking (don't wait for a mode change)
    - when tanks are in attack mode.. they should move around differently,
        don't get so hung up trying to get to leader, perhaps
    - if have most of the upgrades, we should wait it out (ambush of tanks, and EMP defense)
    
    - don't build tanks early enough: see game 653.rms
    - any archon needs to be able to call for attack mode..
        - need to make sure there aren't lots of leader exchanges when all archons
            are trying to call for attack mode
    - have a sacrificial archon ambsorb all the EMPs from a camping EMP thing
    


- SCARY STRATEGIES
    - tank rush on a small map work here
    - mobile EMP rush





Lie down, or take a seat
I have dark news
remember... the article I showed you yesterday?
It's true
what I thought was true
but they don't know





- areas for improvement to our strategy:
    - problem with path finding: see game 638.rms
        - the leader should have switched, but got into a "back-and-forth" situation
    - make better decision about when to attack
        - sometimes we walk past the enemy, sustaining damage,
            because their Archons never get close enough to us for us to enter attack mode
    - lower thresholds for building when we are in no immediate danger
    - better tank healing (maybe have them call for help)
    
    - have a sacrificial archon ambsorb all the EMPs from a camping EMP thing
    - we should be growing our army when we have more upgrades
    - make good decision about when to attack nearby soldiers, versus their archon
    - tanks should always be oportunistic in attacking (don't wait for a mode change)
    - when tanks are in attack mode.. they should move around differently,
        don't get so hung up trying to get to leader, perhaps
    - if have most of the upgrades, we should wait it out (ambush of tanks, and EMP defense)
    
    - don't build tanks early enough: see game 653.rms
    - any archon needs to be able to call for attack mode..
        - need to make sure there aren't lots of leader exchanges when all archons
            are trying to call for attack mode
    
    - make EMP defense *good*






- attack mode proposal:
    - criterion for attack mode = 1 archon too close, or 4 soldiers too close, or 1 tank
    - first, make any archon able to call for attack mode



Intelligence:
    - (probably) 4 archons in square iff stationary
    - detonating an EMP is positive reinforcement to keep that up
    - seeing a lot of enemy fighters if positive reinforcement for EMP defense



Clever Things:
    - scraficial archon
    - emergent complexity wall
    - rail-gun

Dimensions:
    1. Movement: Hunker down vs. Roam map together vs. Roam map apart
        - Hunker:
            - allows good defense (ambush)
            - less upgrades
        - Roam Together:
            - might walk into ambush (need to avoid this)
            - not as good defense
            - more upgrades
        - Roam apart:
            - can collect more upgrades
            - more susceptable to ambush (or any attack)
            - could ambush enemy from both sides
            - could send EMPs from both sides
    2. Air: EMP offense vs EMP defense vs no Air-Force
        - EMP offense
            - might do EMP damage
            - costs energy (less ground defense)
        - EMP defense
            - might be worthless
            - costs energy (but perhaps less than EMP offense, could have larger ground force)
            - could become offense
    3. Ground: Tanks vs Soldiers
        - Tanks:
            - good focus fire
            - can die from soldiers getting next to them
        - Soldiers:
            - cheap, easy, fast,
            - pesky (can keep them coming)

Response Dimensions:
    1. Seek & Destroy vs. Upgrades
    2. EMPs: kill EMPs vs. decrease their production vs. increase our production


    


- strategies:
    - EMPs camped out
    - roaming Archons with soldiers helping them out
        - sometimes they would use EMPs
        - sometimes grouped Archons, sometimes free roaming


    - specific strategies:
        - EMP 1:
            - camped out
            - send waves of scouts (that make an EMP)
            - builds defense when we get too close
            
            
                * dangers:
                    - wave may be particularly hard to stop
                    - we loose by not having much production (too many EMP hits)
                    - we loose by attacking them, and loosing the battle
                    
                * Sacrificial Archon
                    - absorbs EMPs
                    - allows us to get enough upgrades
                * Collect Upgrades Together
                    - Have good EMP defense
                    - don't attack enemy
                    - collect upgrades
            
        - EMP 2:
            - camped out
            - sends stream of scouts (that make an EMP)
            - builds defense when we get too close
            
                * dangers:
                    - same as EMP 1
            
        - Upgrade
            - send out Archons individually for upgrades (no army)
            
                * dangers:
                    - they collect more upgrades than us
                    
                * Collect Upgrades Apart
                    - Spread out and collect upgrades (to compete with collection
                * Seek and Destroy (as a group)
                    - go around in a group, but focus on killing enemy,
                        as opposed to collecting upgrades
                        
        - Upgrade with little armies
            - archons are individual, but have ground armies (of a tank, some soldiers)
            
                * dangers:
                    - they get more upgrades
                    - they might even kill us
                    
                * Seek and Destroy (as a group)
                    - go around in a group, but focus on killing enemy,
                        as opposed to collecting upgrades
                    - with tanks (maybe a soldier?)
                        
                * Roaming EMP
                    - roam as a group with an army
                    - also produce EMPs
                * Slow moving EMP force (with ground defense on demand)
                
        - Upgrade with little armies (and EMP defense)
            - archons are individual, but have ground armies (of a tank, some soldiers, and SAMs, or other EMP defense)
            
                * dangers:
                    - they get more upgrades
                    - they might even kill us
            
                * Seek and Destroy (as a group)
                
        - Upgrade with little armies, and also some EMPs
            - archons are individuall
            - small groups of soldiers
            - EMPs
            
                * dangers:
                    - they get more upgrades
                    - they might kill us
                    - they might EMP us
                    
                * Seek and Destroy with Tanks and EMP defense (scout cloud)
                
                    
        - Seek and Destroy with Tanks and EMPs
            - ignore powerups, try to go after enemy
            
            
                * collect upgrades with Tanks and EMP defense
                    - grow the army
                * collect upgrades (not too many) and set up ambush (with EMP defense)


        - collect upgrades (not too many) and set up ambush (with EMP defense)
        
        
                * collect more upgrades, somehow
                * build bigger army (take advantage of not building air units)
                
        - collect upgrades (not too many) and set up ambush (with EMPs)
        
        
                * collect more upgrades, somehow
                * build bigger army (take advantage of not building air units)


        - Soldier Army
            - walk around with Archons grouped
            - have lots of soldiers greedily attacking whoever they see
            
                
            
            
        - Running Away
            - free roaming Archons
            - collecting upgrades
            - running from battle
        - Big Ambush
            - camped out
            - build lots of tanks
            - wait for enemy to approach
        - Roaming Ambush
            - roaming (slowly)

            - long line of scouts, all healing each other, EMP flys along it to increase range
        - Emergent Complexity Wall
            - wall of scouts, then wave with an EMP
        - just EMPs
            - send out completed EMPs as fast as possible
        - EMP groups
            - send out about 3-4 completed EMPs at a time (perhaps accompanies by scouts)
        1. SAM defense
            - lots of sams
            - some ground defense
        2. Roaming Armies
            - little armies around each archon
            - no air, so maybe 2 tanks, or a tank and 5 soldiers (each archon)
        3. Circling Ambush
            - roam independently, but try to circle around on all sides
        4. Army Rush
            - come to us as quickly as possible with a land force
        5. EMP Rush
            - walk toward us and do the campy EMP thing
        6. Close Combat
            - try to get their archons right next to ours
